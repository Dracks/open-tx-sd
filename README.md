# OpenTX SD Card data

A simple way to update the opentx sd files when a new version is released, simply clone this project on the sdcard, and do git pull when a new version is ready. 

That way git will handle all the updates of files, and you will not worry anymore of changing and knowing what was changed. 


At this moment, I only have the sounds of es, en and de in the SDCard to simplify, if you need something new, ask me or give me a P/R, I will merge as soon as possible.
